## FAQ

- Can I use this under license X?
No, but there is probably no need for that. This project uses the MIT license, which is very
permissive license. You can even sell this code if you want. The unwillingness of relicensing is
of practical reasons, but also because MIT gives us the authors a good liability protection.
